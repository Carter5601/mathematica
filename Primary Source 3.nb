                  Erwin' s Schrodinger' s The Present Situation of Quantum \
Mechanics
              Author
              Erwin Schrodinger was born in Erdberg, Vienna, Austria on \
August 1887. Schrodinger' s father was a famous chemist who devoted his \
latter years to Italian painting.Erwin Schrodinger displayed an interest in \
science as a young boy, however, he hated learning from books and memorizing \
data.He loved German poetry and grammar.From 1906 to 1910, Schrodinger \
studied at the University of Vienna.Schrodinger constantly questioned \
previous scientific thought, rejecting the fact that the Bohr model told us \
everything we need to know about the atom.Schrodinger won the Noble Prize in \
Physics in 1933 for his work that showed that electrons have properties of \
both waves and particles.
              Summary
            In \"The Present Situation of Quantum Mechanics,\" Schrodinger \
begins by explaining the recent happenings of classical physics.He then \
questions why we cannot embrace these thoughts \"without handcuffing the \
intuitive imagination.\" Schrodinger then continues to talk about classical \
physics and how quantum mechanics ties into the concepts that all scientists \
had held dear for centuries.One powerful example of Schrodinger' s ability to \
connect quantum mechanics with imaginative intuition is his inclusion of the \
\"Schrodinger' s Cat\" parable.He uses this thought experiment to describe \
how electrons can be both absent and present, until we map their probability \
with the uncertainty principle.
            Analysis
      Erwin Schrodinger spent his entire life going against the grain of \
classical physics.Most physicist hated quantum physics.Many held onto the \
idea of an all - encompassing, ever - present ether that allowed light to \
travel through its own medium.This idea aligned best with classical thought \
and went well with classical intuition.Therefore, most physicists disregarded \
the first quantum mechanical ideas.
      Schrodinger was different, however.His mind operated on a different \
plane than most of the physicists of his day.With his work with Dirac on the \
uncertainty principle and Schrodinger' s Equation, he changed the way physics \
was viewed.Although many physicists were wary of these ideas, they could not \
deny their veracity.They connected well to Bohr' s model and answered many \
questions.Additionally, they were confirmed by experiment after some years.
      Schrodinger built the foundation of modern physics.Newtonian physics \
focused on ideas of forces, mass, and motion.Schrodinger showed that quantum \
physics and small - scale physics should rather be based on potentials, \
energy as mass, and probabilities.These ideas revolutionized physics and made \
it into the modern physics that we know today.
      Research Question
  What is the benefit of looking at a scientific principle or avenue from a \
different point of view?How can imagination and other \"odd methods\" of \
approaching scientific thought advance scientific ideas and revolutionize the \
world' s knowledge of truth?\
