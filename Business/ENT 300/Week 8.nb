Honesty.

Persuasion is a righteous action. Persuasion is to understand what the other \

Autonomy - Let people direct themselves. One day of unfettered autonomy \
produces better results than seven days of directed work.
Mastery - People like to get better at things. Why do people play the piano \
on their own time? 
Purpose - People like to have a passion. They like to do what they love. They \
like to make the world a better place. Effective managers condense their \
purpose into an effective slogan, like a packet of light that can ignite the \
fire of passion in employment. I want to help people unlock their genius gene. 

NOT MONEY!!!

Money can solve some problems, but it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the one-on-one that \
solves all problems.

 "To be great at sales, you have to give up your best interest.\n\nDo not \
start a sales conversation by telling them the price. If they ask for the \
price, say \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Is this something that would work for you.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] If you have bundles or different sizes and they do \
say they are interested in the product then say, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What \
size do you think you would need.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\n\nSales can be a \
righteous activity because of the way you are doing it.\n\nDo not embellish \
your product. State the facts. Outline the problem. Tell then you can provide \
a solution. Make it obvious that you have their best interest in heart.\n\n\
The heart of sales is \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]How can I help? What do you \
need?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] These are questions that resolve any personal \
conflict. If it is genuine, it will always, always work.\n\nDo not price your \
product on cost. Price your product on the value you have created for the \
customer. Price your product on need. \n\nSale so that the customer always \
comes out ahead. \n\nNot every customer has value. Fire bad customers. You \
cannot satisfy a bad customer. Firing bad customers allows you to make more \
money in the same space.\n\nBad customers\n- Do not pay their bill on time\n- \
They complain about the wrong things (what the price was)\n- They don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t give me 100% of their business\n- They always want a deal \
or a reduction in price (the focus is on price)\n- They waste my time. They \
do not run a good ship.\n\nYou can succeed in business by doing eight things \
right and 15 things wrong.\n\nGo overboard treating your customers well. I \
want to treat them so well that they would never think about leaving, even if \
I have to sacrifice part of myself to do it. This also applies to dating.\n\n\
The bad reviews validate the good reviews."
