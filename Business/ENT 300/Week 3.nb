Evidence that you are learning is that your life is changing, that you are \
improving.
People are negative because they see scarcity rather than abundance; they are \
also incredibly selfish. Selfishness is the root of every sin.
Every time you fail, you learn something. Failure only leads to success if we \
learn something from it.
Being a perfectionist is selfish.
Anyplace you can learn, take it. You ought to have a thirst for learning and \
a thirst for experiences. 
Relish failure from effort. Become good at learning from your own \
experiences. Become good at trying new things. 
Sometimes the price is too low. Sometimes you have to move it up so people \
believe it is good.\
